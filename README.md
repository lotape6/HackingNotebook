This repo (Obsidian Vault) aims to collect different personal notes learned about hacking in sandbox platforms like Hack The Box or LetsDefend. All the interesting commands gathered along the practice are collected over [Cheatsheets](https://github.com/lotape6/HackingNotebook/tree/master/Cheatsheets).
This repo is for personal use, so I'm sorry about the poor organization and description. The thing you may find more interesting are cheatsheets themselves.

Currently there are two different HTB tracks being done:
- [Intro to Blue Team](https://github.com/lotape6/HackingNotebook/tree/master/Tracks/Intro_to_blue_team) (finished)
- [CREST_CRT](https://github.com/lotape6/HackingNotebook/tree/master/Tracks/crest_crt) (in progress)

There are also some malicious files being analyzed over [MalwareAnalysis](https://github.com/lotape6/HackingNotebook/tree/master/MalwareAnalysis). Files were found on https://bazaar.abuse.ch/
